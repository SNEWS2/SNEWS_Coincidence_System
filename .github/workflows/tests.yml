# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: tests

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - release_*
      - test-and-format # just checking if it works - should delete!
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - release_*

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
